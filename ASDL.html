	<h2>Summary :</h2>
	<p>In addition to completing the required Master's coursework, I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistance (GRA) at the Aerospace Systems Design Lab (ASDL). Working as a GRA at the ASDL entails participating in deliverable-focused projects with a high level of collaboration and interaction with industry partners.</p>
	<p>The project I am working on as a GRA is sponsored by the Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT), an entity funded by NASA and the FAA among others. This project is focused on a wide variety of tasks revolving around the study and design of a supersonic commercial aircraft for the near future. The work I have been completing as part of this project is focused on aerodynamics.</p>
	<h2>My Contribution :</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Used a low-fidelity aerodynamic analysis tool to obtain correction factors used to correlate low-fidelity aerodynamic data to high-fidelity data obtained from CFD analysis.</li>
	</ul>
