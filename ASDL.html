		<h1>Aerospace Systems Design Lab</h1>
		Role: Graduate Research Assistant<br>
	</div>
	<h2>Introduction :</h2>
	<p>In parallel to completing the academic portion of my Master's degree, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) at the Aerospace Systems Design Lab (ASDL). This work started the first semester of my Master's degree through the second to last semester where I transitioned to working part-time at an aerospace startup. Working as a GRA at the ASDL entails participating in deliverable-focused projects with a high level of collaboration and interaction with industry partners. As a GRA, I worked on three different research projects, the first involving urban aerial mobility, the second involving analysis of electric aircraft, and the third involving the coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - Rigid Body Dynamics (RBD) simulation of planetary entry vehicles. The following gives more details regarding my contributions to the CFD-RBD project as this is an ongoing project.</p>

	<h2>Project Introduction :</h2>
	<p>There is significant interest of sending various scientific missions to the Martian surface. Due to the large amount of kinetic energy coming from an interplanetary trajectory, such missions typically opt for a blunt-body capsule which allow for dissipation of kinetic energy though a strong bow shock. While free-flight projectiles of many different types are often studied using coupled CFD-RBD simulations, Mars entry capsules have the added complexity of being actively controlled using Reaction Control Systems (RCS). This entails that typical CFD-RBD simulation frameworks are not adaquately equipped to study such problems and additional capabilities must be added to such environments to study the planetary entry of RCS-controlled Mars vehicles. While I am no longer working on the project as part of my funded research, this project is the focus of a long term academic projec that I will be working on through graduation.</p>
