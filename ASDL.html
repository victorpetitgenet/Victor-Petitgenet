		Role: Graduate Research Assistant<br>
	</div>
	<h2>Introduction :</h2>
	<p>In addition to completing the required Master's coursework, I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistance (GRA) at the Aerospace Systems Design Lab (ASDL). Working as a GRA at the ASDL entails participating in deliverable-focused projects with a high level of collaboration and interaction with industry partners. As a GRA, I have worked on three different research projects, two of which are ongoing. The following gives more details regarding my contributions to these projects and their timelines</p>
	<h1 style="font-size:22px"><u>NASA Langley Trajectory Simulation with Coupled CFD Aerodynamics (September 2020 - Present)</u></h1>
	<h2>Project Introduction :</h2>
	<p>This project is focused on the creation of a framework coupling a six degree of freedom rigid body dynamics simulation with computational fluid dynamics to simulate the trajectory of reentry vehicles. This is of value due to the interaction of RCS thruster exhaust with the reentry vehicle's wake which causes deviations from expected behavior as noted during previous Mars lander missions. Successfully creating this framework will allow for an accurate representation of a planetary entry vehicle's trajectory upon reentry.</p> 
	<h2>My Contribution :</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Addressing the challenges posed by activiting and de-activating the RCS thrusters used to control the entry vehicle. This will be the focus of a long-term project lasting through May 2021.</li>
	</ul> 
	<h1 style="font-size:22px"><u>Boeing Hand-Launched UAV Project (August 2020 - Present)</u></h1>
	<p>This is a short term research project focused on performing mission analysis and vehicle systems sizing for a hand-launched UAV using the ASDL-developed Electric Architecture Sizing and Synthesis (EPASS) tool.
	<h2>My Contribution</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Adapting EPASS tool for use with hand-launched UAVs.</li>
		<li>Running mission analysis and vehicle systems sizing using EPASS.</li>
	</ul>
