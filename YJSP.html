	<h2>Summary :</h2>
	<p>The Yellow Jacket Space Program (YJSP) is a student led initiative working on the development of a liquid fueled rocket designed to reach an altitude of at least 100km. YJSP is responsible for the development and testing of all components of the launch vehicle. Within YJSP, I worked on the Systems Engineering team. More information on YJSP can be found by following this <a href='https://www.gtspaceprogram.com/' target='_blank'><u>link</u></a>.</p>

	<h2>My Contribution :</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Developed a code for the 1<sup>st</sup> order estimation of the rocket's skin temperature throughout it's planned trajectory. I adapted a method published in a publicly available paper to fit the needs of this project. The outputs from this code were then used to inform design decision including the material choice for the rocket's nose cone and other aerodynamic surfaces.</li>
		<li>Worked on requirements development for the launch-vehicle. Worked with members of the systems engineering team to develop appropriate requirements ensuring that the appropriate vehicle systems were being designed.</li>
		<li>Worked on an uncertainty propagation exercise to understand the uncertainty related to the rocket's position throughout its flight based on the sensors integrated in the vehicle. Implemented a variety of uncertainty propagation relationships within a Matlab script to quantify the uncertainty with respect the rocket's position.</li>
