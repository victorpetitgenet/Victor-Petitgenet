	<h2>Summary :</h2>
	<p>Momentus is a new-space startup that is focused on providing the infrastructure services necessary to expand human activity in sapce. This first steps towards this long-term goals are being taken by the Vigoride spacecraft which leverages a water-based propulsion technology to deliver customer satellites to their desired orbits. I am currently working at Momentus in the Systems Engineering department as a part-time intern in parallel with my Master's degree.</p>
	<h2>My Contribution :</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The bulk of my work at Momentus is focused on performing the analyses necessary to decompose high level product requirements to lower-level subsystem requirements. This includes a combination of "hand calculations" and more formal analyses conducted using Python or Matlab.</li>
		<li>As part of my internship I have taken owernship of simulation tools that are used to perform RCS propellant usage calculations. This involves code written in Python as well as Julia.</li>
		<li>I am also devoting some of my efforts to preliminary wiring harness design.</li>
