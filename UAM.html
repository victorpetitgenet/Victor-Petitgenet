		<h1>A Framework for the Evaluation of Urban Air Mobility System-of-System</h1>
		August 2019 - May 2020
	</div>
	<h2>Summary :</h2>
	<p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is proposed as an alternative means of transportation within urban areas. Due to a convergence or enablers including namely improved battery technology and artifical intelligence among others, UAM implementations are rapidly approaching feasibility. As such, in the near future, decision-makers will be faced with the challenge of deciding which UAM implementation is most suitable to their particular situation. This being said, the UAM as a System-of-Systems (SoS) consists of thousands of different elements and performing decision making becomes unmanageable due to the number of possible alternatives.</p>
	<p>This project, completed with the support of Saab Technologies, sought to devise a methodology to facilitate decision-making and evaluation of highly-complex and interconnected SoS. This methodology was then demonstrated through the evaluation of different implementations of a UAM "Airport Shuttle" within the city of Atlanta, Georgia. This involved the creation of a computation environment to allow for the evaluation of different alternatives and an accompanying dashboard to facilitate user interaction and decision making.</p>
	<h2>My Contribution :</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Took on the responsibilities of team lead including handling communication between the student team and research engineers and sponsors as well as decomposing and assigning tasks.</li>
		<li>Participated in the synthesis of the methodology for the evaluation of System-of-Systems.</li>
		<li>Developed a "Societal Impact" module for the computational framework. This module calculated the number of people exposed to high-levels of noise coming from the vehicles in the UAM SoS.</li>
		<li>Developed the dashboard which was paired with the computational environment to facilitate decision making.</li>
		<li>Presented the project to various industry leaders during the ASDL's External Advisory Board.</li>
