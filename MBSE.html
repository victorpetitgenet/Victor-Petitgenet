		<h1>Airbus Flight Physics Model-Based Systems Engineering Project</h1>
		June 2017 - December 2017
	</div>
	<h2>Summary :</h2>
	<p>This project was completed with ASDL during my time as an undergraduate researcher. Sponsored by Airbus and supported by personnel, data, and models from Airbus Flight Physics the aim of this project was to work on applying Multi-Disciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) techniques to the design of an aerospace system within a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) framework. The initial implementation of the project was focused on the implications of a winglet retrofit to an existing aircraft platform.</p>
	<p>As a project focused on allowing for the analysis and design of the entire aircraft, all of the disciplines and analysis necessary for the design of an aerospace system were involved. As such, throughout my participation in the project, I had the opportunity to experience and interact with a variety of these different areas.</p>
	<h2>My Contribution :</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Created functional and physical breakdowns of the aircraft to be used down the line in MBSE activities.</li>
		<li>Extracted dimensions from a CAD model of the aircraft supplied by Airbus.</li>
		<li>Performed mission analysis using NASA's Flight Optimization System (FLOPS).</li>
	</ul>
