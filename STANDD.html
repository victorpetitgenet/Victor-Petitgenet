		<h1>A Single Digital Thread Approach to Aircraft Detailed Design</h1>

	<h2>Summary :</h2>
	<p>This project was completed with ASDL during my time as an undergraduate researcher. Sponsored by Airbus, this project was initiated at an open-ended investigation into ways to reduce the design cycle time for commercial aircraft. My participation on the project spanned over two years which encompassed two phases of the project.</p>
	<p>The first phase was focused on identifying an area within the Airbus design cycle for commercial aircraft where we believed there was a significant potential for time savings. Through extensive collaboration with Airbus engineers in the US and Europe, the detailed design phase of aircraft design was identified as a promising candidate. In this phase, there was a signigicant amount of time spent in the loop of manually extracting dimensions from a "dummy" CAD model (containing no feature tree), inputting these features into an Airbus proprietary analysis tool, and making changes to the CAD model based off the results of the analysis. As such, the first phase of the project was focused on developping software solutions to provide automative feature extraction from the CAD model in a format compatible with the Airbus analysis tool, with the use case focused on the aircraft wing rib. This phase of the project culminated with a publication to the AIAA SciTech Forum.</p>
	<p>The second phase of the project was focused on intervening in the now increasingly automated loop of feature extraction, analysis, and redesign to implement an optimization routine to suggest possibilities to reduce the weight of the aircraft wing rib based on the results of the analysis tool. This was implemented as part of discussions with Airbus where it became apparent that there was a significant amount of implicit knowledge and experience necessary to use the results of the analysis tool to make changes to the part's CAD model. Implementing this optimization routine reduced the reliance on experience and implicit knowledge by making suggestions about possibilities to reduce the part's mass. This optimization was implemented and demonstrated a significant weight savings across the aircraft wing.</p>
