		<h1>A Coupled Approach to the Design Space Exploration of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion Systems</h1>
		August 2019 - Present
	</div>
	<h2>Summary :<br></h2>
	<p>Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) systems have been a technology of interest to space exploration since as early as the 1950s due to their potential for improved efficiency as compared to traditional propulsion systems while being able to produce comparable amounts of thrust. More recently, NTP system have been identified as a promising candidate for future manned and un-manned missions to Mars by NASA in the Mars DRA 5.0 document. Moving towards a sustainable human presence on interplanetary destinations, there is a need to support such analysis with appropriate tools and capabilities. One such capability is design space exploration which allows for the investigation of the entire design space in a manageable manner.</p>
	<p>The study of NTP systems is particularly challenging due to the highly coupled nature of the nuclear reactor to the surrounding  subsystems and components. As a result, conventional approach to the analysis of such systems tend to approach the problem in a decoupled fashion where the reactor and the surrounding subsystems are treated seperately. Such an approach presents significant limitations due to the sensitivity of the reactor to the surrounding systems. The objective of this research project was to develop and demonstrate a novel methodology which allows for the coupled analysis of NTP systems and using the resulting model to enable rapid design space exploration.</p>
	<h2>My Contribution :<br></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Created a structure and plan for the development of a coupled NTP system model.</li>
		<li>Created a code for the simplified cycle analysis of an NTP system to envelope the boundary conditions of the nuclear reactor within the NTP system</li>
		<li>Created a code that uses the outputs of the NTP system model to provide insight with regard to the performance of a hypothetical NTP powered crewed Mars transfer vehicle launched on SLS Block 2 or Starship.</li>
